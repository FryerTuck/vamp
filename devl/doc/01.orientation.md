## Introduction

#### Structure
VAMP is all about structure. It is made up of 4 main folders, which is also used to extend the language if you wish, but the stock language is pretty darn good, so give it a try before you start tweaking.<br>
The "core" defines the relationships of the main folders their sub-folders; however, each sub-folder and their api's may refer to the main folders & their sub-folders.

The 4 main folders are:
- `bios` - basic input output system
- `core` - the main parts of the system
- `mime` - multipurpose internet media extensions
- `view` - the source of all GUI parts & libraries

Inside each of these folders are 5 sub-folders that are used to define & extend their own parent, so they are exclusively related - each to their own parent main folder. The design of this is very important as it helps with portability when developing VAMP extensions. Each of these 5 folders are named exactly the same inside each main folder -- remember that they are related to their own parent, so they define and extend only their own parent.

The 5 sub-folders in each main folder are:
- `api` - application programming interface
- `cfg` - configuration
- `ext` - extra, or extended
- `lib` - code library
- `mod` - modifications, or modules


The reason why the above is so explicitly described is because it is very important; once you get this, the rest is very easy.
