## Introduction

As its acronym suggests, VAMP is indeed versatile.<br>
Here's a few things you should know:
- it has an interpreter (daemon), a compiler, and an extensible transpiler
- it can transpile any mime-type it has a mime-library extension for
- it is securely scalable across several servers -or domains, for n-tier software architecture
- it can be used for both server-side & client side and its syntax is clean & easy to learn
- it can create, read & listen on any permissible resource, path, socket, & child-process
- it can be used as an active database, or used for programming, configuration and content authoring
- it has a configurable "view" mechanism, both for CLI & GUI - which have similar instructions
- it is built to be stable, so it will not crash (under normal conditions)
- it runs in its own directory which is your runtime "project root"
- its directory and file structure is part of the live runtime structure where folders are "nodes" (objects)
- structures (like "nodes") can be defined inside VAMP files, not only folders
- its structure is loaded at "boot time" and lives in memory; more on this in a bit, keep reading
- the live structure entities (and attributes) are referenced as "pointers", so it runs fast
- anything in the runtime has "meta-attributes", called "aspects" some of which are "intrinsic"
- the intrinsic concepts & aspects are designed for rapid prototyping and development
- the mathematical expressions are designed to be "safe", so it handles things like "devision by zero" well
- the mathematical expressions handle any data-type, -not only numbers

The power of VAMP lies in its simplicity, structure, extensibility, portability and runtime stability; alas -it is up to the systems engineer to lay out the proper architecture.<br>

However bold these claims seem, there is much more to elaborate on the points above, and even more,<br>
so keep reading...  It won't hurt &nbsp; :)

## Installation
VAMP can be installed from its repository here: https://github.com/xacra/vamp<br>
Navigate to the `dist/bin` folder, in which you will find a list of folders named according to the supported operating systems.

</div>
<br>

#### Linux

- Download the `vampSetup.sh` file from the `linux` folder.
- From the terminal, navigate to where it downloaded and make sure it is executable.
- Type: `./vampSetup.sh` and follow the prompts.
- To test if VAMP was sucessfully installed, type: `vamp -v` and you should see something like: `0.1.0`

<br>

#### OSX & Windows

- Coming soon!

## Development Environment

VAMP does not require a specific development environment at all. You can simply install VAMP on which ever host-machine you want and use a plain text editor for coding, and a terminal to run or compile your projects; however if you're serious about your work you should at least run your test server on a separate host (or virtual machine) - and use some a proper text editor for programming.

Throughout this documentation, the file extention: `.v` is used for "vamp" files. Your local machine's operating system may already have the ".v" file extention associated with some other application; however, you do not need to use the `.v` file extention exclusively; - see the "Hello World" section below for more info on which alternative file extentions to use.

File extentions in VAMP are important. Not only is it easy to spot for a human, but also, the VAMP interpreter can recognize combination file extentions, like: `style.css.v` and process it "explicitly"; -where if the `.css.` part is missing, then it is processed "implicitly" - which is slower.<br>
If you have the VAMP SDK package installed, the icons in your local file browser will show recognizable icons for VAMP files, and combinations also.
<br><br>


### Virtual machine
There are many VM solutions out there, the solution I recommend is using `VirtualBox` with `Arch Linux` running on a machine you configured; but you can use anything you like.

To take advantage of "compiling" it is recommended that you assign at least 2 virtual CPU's to your VM -with at least 2Gb of RAM. The machine does not need a GUI, so you can just use a minimal installation and set it up the way you want. You can also launch your VBox "headless" (without a "window") from the terminal and have it run in the background.

You can also "mount" a folder (path) which is on your virtual machine into a folder of your local machine. This is very useful for quick navigation, screen-shots, etc - using your local machine's file-manager to manage files & folders on your Vbox.

Consult the internet for more info on this as there are plenty tutorials on how to do these things - which is not in the scope of this document, but I thought it's worth mentioning to have something that "just works" without much hassle. It is very useful; not only for VAMP, but for your other projects as well.

<br><br>


### Syntax highlighting
It is important that your text editor supports syntax highlighting of some kind as it makes it easier to identify what your're typing.

If your text editor does not support VAMP syntax bt default, there may be a syntax highlighting package for your editor  in the VAMP repository.<br>
Have a look here: https://github.com/xacra/vamp/tree/master/devl/ext/editor

At the time of this writing there is a syntax highlighting package available for `Atom`, so you can just install it.

## Hello World
This excercize is actually very quick, but for the sake of getting a firm grasp of VAMP, we'll take it step by step.<br>
Note that you do not need to do the "mounting" thing, and you also do not need the VAMP SDK;  these are just to make things more "user friendly" for yourself while you develop VAMP projects.

Read the following first - so you know exactly what to expect:

1. Any VAMP project needs its own folder (which defines the runtime scope)
2. VAMP files can have any of the following file extentions: `.v` `.va` `.vam` `.vamp`
3. `$` (meta) files are optional, but mandatory in `project root` and refer to the folder they are in
4. items in folders are loaded sequentially in ascending order by name, so `$` files are loaded first
5. the contents of VAMP files are statements in the context of the file-name and folder hierarchy
6. statements are evaluated by context, parsed from left-to-right and top-to-bottom
7. the return value of any statement(s) is determined implicitly or explicitly

<br>
For clarity & brevity, I'll assume the following:
- you have installed VAMP on your development server and have installed the VAMP SDK on your local machine;
- you're using a `Linux` machine as project server (where VAMP is installed);
- you have mounted the folder path of this server in which your VAMP projects will reside --onto your local file-system;
- you either have a terminal window open that is connected to this dev server via SSH, or simply just the open VBOX window that runs your dev server.

Let's get started:
- Navigate to your VAMP projects container (folder) -
- Create a new folder somewhere you want to have a new VAMP project i.e: `/srv/vamp/example.com`<br>
- Inside this `example.com` folder, create a text file named: `$.v` (take note of the file extention)

Your `project root` structure of "example.com" should now look something like this:
<div class="frame span">
   <img src="../art/img/01.demo_path.png">
</div>
<span class="info">above :: project root of "example.com"</span>

From the pointers above, no.7 is impotant here, because in this excercise the "return value" is "implied".<br>


- In your favorite text editor, open the file you just created and type the following inside it extactly:

```vamp
Hello World!
```
- Save your changes, then open a terminal and type the following: `vamp init /home/midna/demo`

You should see something like this:
```vamp
> Hello World!
```
Congrads!

### Extensibility

The mime-type library in VAMP comes default with transpilers for:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PlainText

If the mime-type is not available on the VAMP repository, then you can simply make your own.<br>
The punch-line here is that you can code in one language and have your instructions translated (or compiled) to any other mime-type, depending on what you're authoring and what the target platform is of coarse.

   <img src="../art/img/01.vamp_to_mime.png">
</div>
<span class="info">above :: illustration of possible mime-type compilations</span>
<br><br>

You can also compile your VAMP project into a stand-alone exectutable; which could be anything, from a systems API or service, a plug-in or module for another service -to native desktop GUI applications.<br>
Depending on your development setup, the VAMP compiler can compile executable that runs natively on Linux, OSX & Windows.<br>

VAMP's built-in "view" mechanism saves a lot of time.
