## Introduction

As its acronym suggests, VAMP is indeed versatile.<br>
Here's a few things you should know:
- it has an interpreter (daemon), a compiler, and an extensible transpiler
- it can transpile any mime-type it has a mime-library extension for
- it is securely scalable across several servers -or domains, for n-tier software architecture
- it can be used for both server-side & client side and its syntax is clean & easy to learn
- it can create, read & listen on any permissible resource, path, socket, & child-process
- it can be used as an active database, or used for programming, configuration and content authoring
- it has a configurable "view" mechanism, both for CLI & GUI - which have similar instructions
- it is built to be stable, so it will not crash (under normal conditions)
- it runs in its own directory which is your runtime "project root"
- its directory and file structure is part of the live runtime structure where folders are "nodes" (objects)
- structures (like "nodes") can be defined inside VAMP files, not only folders
- its structure is loaded at "boot time" and lives in memory; more on this in a bit, keep reading
- the live structure entities (and attributes) are referenced as "pointers", so it runs fast
- anything in the runtime has "meta-attributes", called "aspects" some of which are "intrinsic"
- the intrinsic concepts & aspects are designed for rapid prototyping and development
- the mathematical expressions are designed to be "safe", so it handles things like "devision by zero" well
- the mathematical expressions handle any data-type, -not only numbers

The power of VAMP lies in its simplicity, structure, extensibility, portability and runtime stability; alas -it is up to the systems engineer to lay out the proper architecture.<br>

However bold these claims seem, there is much more to elaborate on the points above, and even more,<br>
so keep reading...  It won't hurt &nbsp; :)

### Installation
VAMP can be installed from its repository here: https://github.com/xacra/vamp<br>
Navigate to the `dist/bin` folder, in which you will find a list of folders named according to the supported operating systems.

#### Linux

- Navigate to where it downloaded and make sure it is executable
- Open a term





### Extensibility

The mime-type library in VAMP comes default with transpilers for:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PlainText

If the mime-type is not available on the VAMP repository, then you can simply make your own.<br>
The punch-line here is that you can code in one language and have your instructions translated (or compiled) to any other mime-type, depending on what you're authoring and what the target platform is of coarse.

<br><br>

You can also compile your VAMP project into a stand-alone exectutable; which could be anything, from a systems API or service, a plug-in or module for another service -to native desktop GUI applications.<br>
Depending on your development setup, the VAMP compiler can compile executable that runs natively on Linux, OSX & Windows.<br>

VAMP's built-in "view" mechanism saves a lot of time.
