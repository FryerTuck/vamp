## Context

Everything in your entire VAMP project structure is based on: "concepts", "contexts", "aspects" and "values".<br>
At "project root" level, everything directly inside it are referred to as "concepts" - which exist in the "context" of your "project root".

The "aspects" of every "context" -or "concept" has "values" which define its attributes, relationships, methods, and contents. The collective for "aspects" is simply referred to as `meta`, represented by the `$` character wich means "self".

Contexts can be defined anywhere in your project tree by folders & files (or symbolic links), as each of these need to be named something.<br>
Contexts can also be defined inside VAMP files using the "context operators".<br>
As you may have guessed by now that you cannot simply access any "path" (folder or file) on the local system (where VAMP is installed), because your VAMP runtime (project) can only access its own contents; however, if you need to access something outside of your project tree, then you can use "symlinks" to do so. These links can be defined either "implicitly" or "explicitly". The reasons for this is both for security and structure simplity, but we'll get to these later.


It is important to note in these docs about references to "implicit" & "explicit". Vamp is designed to make your life easier, so if things get done "implicitly" it simply means: "automatically done the way it it is implied"; where "explicitly" means: "do the followng exactly".

The difference between "implicit" and "explicit" is:
- "implicit" is faster to code for a developer, but runs a bit slower during runtime
- "explicit" runs a bit faster during runtime, but sometimes require more coding
<br><br>

With the above in mind, when using the following operators after a named (or unnamed) entity, it usually means this:
- the `:` operator defines -or re-defines an entity (or result) explicitly;
- the `{}` and `[]` and `()` operators defines -or `{modifies}` -or `[extends]` -or `(calls)` an entity (or result) implicitly.

The rest of this doc will explain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>





### Aspects

Here is an example of how to define some "thing" and give it some properties:

```vamp
ride {color:'blue', roof:'none'}
```
From the examle above, the curly braces turned the word "ride" into a "named entity".<br>
This means that it got registered as a "named thing" within the context of wherever the code above resides. It automatically gained a meta-property: "Name" and its Name is: "ride".<br>
It has 3 data-properties: "color", "roof" & "status".

You can access these properties by using the "select" operator `.` (dot) like this:

```vamp
ride.$         ::    {Name:'ride', color:'blue', roof:'none'}
ride.Name      ::    ride
ride.roof      ::    gone
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>





### Contents
To assign contents to an entity, we can either define it with the "content operators", or with the "Gist" aspect like this:

```vamp
ride [ 'some text contents' ]       :: implicitly

ride {Gist:'some text contents'}    :: explicitly

```
<br>
You can also define an entity with aspects and contents with the `{}[]` operator sequence like this:
```vamp
ride {color:'blue', roof:'gone'}
[
   'seats'
]
```
In the example above, the `{}` denotes the aspects of "ride" and the `[]` denotes the "contents" of "ride".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>




### Functions & Methods

A function (or "called on method") is defined with the `()[]` operator sequence like this:
```vamp
ride ()
[
   'vrooom!'
]
```
In the example above, the `()` denotes the arguments of function:"ride" and the `[]` denotes the "contents" of "ride".<br>
When calling `ride()` it will return: `vrooom!`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>





### Definition

VAMP offers different ways of defining, modifying & extending things. This is by design as some things are better to define one way and modify in another way, depending on the dynamics of your logic.
<br><br>

#### define & modify
The following example shows how to create an entity and modify it after:

```vamp
ride: {}

ride.roof: 'no'
ride.Gist: (ride.roof + ' seats')
ride.Call: ()
[
   'vrooom!'
]
```

The example above shows a rather "long winded" way of creating & modifying an entity, but it shows how things are usually done in other languages; however, it works in VAMP also.

In VAMP, the above can be done explicitly without repeating yourself, like this:

```vamp
ride:
{
   roof: 'no'
   Gist: ($.roof + ' seats')
   Call: ()
   [
      'vrooom!'
   ]
}
```

In the example above, the value of "Gist" is assigned in an interesting way.<br>
Here's how it works:
- when an entity is being defined, its defined aspects are availale to the next statement within the same context
- the expression that follows the `:` inherits the current context so `$` (self) refers to "ride"
- `$` has an aspect called "roof" which has a text value: "no".

So, the value of "Gist" in the example above is "no seats"; hence, the contents of "ride" is "no seats".<br>
Erpessions will be covered in detail later, but the above should help getting a firm grasp on how things operate in context.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>





### Calls & some expressions

A "call" is an "expression" that operates on the context of what is "called upon".<br>
In VAMP, anything can be "called" "implicitly" or "explicitly" (with arguments), even if "the thing" does not exist as a named entity.

Calling something without it having a "Call" aspect will return "copies" of values found. This makes a lot of things easy, especially in data-lookups or creating entities from other entities.

When something is called, it does 1 of 4 things, depending on how this thing being called is defined:
- if it does not exist then the "return value" would be "Void" (nothing)
- else-if it has a "Call" aspect (discussed below) then that is `called` accordingly
- else-if it has "contents" then its contents are `searched` accordingly
- else its aspects are `searched` accordingly

The above conditions may seem a bit strange, but when used as such the results are as expected (or implied), depending on your entities and "calls".<br>

Here are some examples of how to "call" things "implicitly"; the comment on the right shows what is returned:

```vamp
ride:
{color:'blue', roof:'none', status:'notorious'}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ride()                     ::    Void
ride('moo')                ::    Void

ride('color')              ::    blue
ride('roof', 'status')     ::    ['none', 'notorious']

ride(Vals @ Keys:`*o*`)    ::    ['blue', 'none']
ride(Keys @ Vals:`*e`)     ::    ['color', 'roof']
ride(Pair @ Vals:`n*`)     ::    [roof:'none', status:'notorious']
ride(Pair @ Pair:`*s`)     ::    [status:'notorious']
```

Let's go through the example above line by line:
1. `ride()`                   &nbsp; no arguments are given, so "nothing" is returned
2. `ride('moo')`              &nbsp; "ride" has no aspect named "moo", so: "nothing" is returned
3. `ride('color')`            &nbsp; the value of aspect "color" in "ride"
4. `ride('roof', 'status')`   &nbsp; the values of aspects "roof" & "status" in "ride"
5. `ride(Vals @ Keys:'*o*')`  &nbsp; the values of keys which contains "o" in the key-name
6. `ride(Keys @ Vals:'*e')`   &nbsp; the keys of values which ends with "e" in the value
7. `ride(Pair @ Vals:'n*')`   &nbsp; the key-value pairs of values that start with "n"
8. `ride(Pair @ Pair:'*s')`   &nbsp; the key-value pairs of key-names & values that end with "s"


The example and explanation above shows how things are called "implicitly", meaning: what is "implied" by the call -depending on what it is called upon.

To call things "explicitly" - it works exactly the same, but in this case you specify exactly what to "call upon", like this:

```vamp
ride.$('roof', 'status')      ::    ['none', 'notorious']
ride.Gist(Keys @ Vals:`*e`)   ::    Void
```
In the example here (above):
1. the `$` is used to select the "aspects" of "ride", so the call is done on the aspects explitly;
2. the "content" (or "Gist aspect") of "ride" is selected, so the call is done on the contents explicitly -which in this case is "nothing" because our "ride" has no contents.
