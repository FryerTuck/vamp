## Introduction
This manual is intended to describe the VAMP language in total; from basics to advanced; however, it is important to have at least some familiarity with any kind of open-source operating systems and software development, like web applications and Linux.<br>
Having an open mind is mandatory, else none of this will make any sense; however, the purpose of VAMP is to be simple and quick to learn.   

VAMP is not only a language; it is also a highly portable "live structure" -which you define. This will be covered in depth later, but first: the following is a taste of what you can expect.
<br><br>

## Synopsis
The following code snippets are to satisfy your curiosity about the language, but Vamp is not only about "code" as you will soon discover. Each code snippet is explained, but if you don't get why or how (yet) don't stress, just keep reading; everything is explained later in greater detail; however, these are crucial to get a firm grasp of the Vamp language.

**context & echo**

```vamp
"Hello World!"
```
By default, a Vamp file runs in "function" (sub-routine) context. If a function does not `explicitly` specify any "return" (echo), then its return-value (echo) is assumed `implicitly`; hence in the case above, a string (constant) is specified - and no `echo` (or anything else). The output of the code above in a vamp file (or a function) will simply be:<br>
`Hello World!`

This means you can define things in a simplistic manner and the result will be as expected; for example:

```vamp
foo: 'bar'
zee: 123.4
```
As you probably expected, the result of the code above is an "object": `{foo:'bar', zee:123.4}`<br>

Notice how you do not need to put a `,` (comma) to separate these? The Vamp interpreter treats a new-line character as a delimiter, so this works for "objects" as well as "arrays". If you put things on the same line, then you will have to use a comma though, else this part would result in a "code fail" (syntax error).

In the last example above, we specified variables `foo` and `zee`, because the `:` operator means ***is***.<br>
These are implied as variables because - remember if no context is specified, the context is then implied as "function context". This means you can do interesting things while defining objects, like:

```vamp
foo: `Hello `
bar: `World!`
zee: (foo + bar)

$Echo(zee)
```
The output of the code here (above) is: `Hello World!`.<br>
Here we ***explicitly*** specified the return-value by calling `Echo` -which belongs to ***this*** ($) context of a function instance. The `$` operator refers to "self" and it can be written as: `$Echo`, or `$.Echo`. This "self" operator refers to the closest (relative) context, always, so use it with care because contexts change inside context operators such as: `( )`, `{ }`, `[ ]`, `" "`, etc.

Notice that we used the *expression context operators* `( )` to perform arithmetic calculation on those variables. Since they are both "strings", the `+` operator implies to ***concatenate*** (concat).

You may have noticed there are 2 new-lines between the variable declarations and the `$echo()` invocation; this is not by accident, and is very important actually.<br>
When you use 2 new-lines, it implies ***next***. Similar to the "and" operator: `,` -the "next" operator: `;` -means "next statement", explicitly marking the end of the previous statement-block.

Now, before you get all worked up about "white-space freedom", when new-lines are concerned, interpretation happens "implicitly"; which means that if you make a bunch of new-lines between declarations of the same kind - in the same context - then it implies you are not done yet - that you just need the extra white-space for code clarity.<br>
Implicit interpretation does not necessarily mean it is slower as it depends on where (and what) you imply.

Vamp expressions are extremely versatile. You can use arithmetic operators on almost any data-type, for example:

```vamp
('abc abc' - 'b')    .:  ac ac
```
